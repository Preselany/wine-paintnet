# Initial validation — September 11, 2026

## Reproduction

* Wine source: `36b6a2cf679fb395f668a917b76537190e212d9c` (11.17).
* Target: official Paint.NET 5.1.12 x64 portable release.
* Host: Ubuntu 24.04.4 x86-64.
* Test display: isolated Xvfb, with DXVK 3.1 selecting llvmpipe.
* Only the rebuilt Wine `d2d1.dll` was installed for the first compatibility fix.
* All 312 application EXE/DLL files matched the verified official archive.

The setup script completed against a second clean work directory using the
pinned download cache. Building the Direct2D module and test executable,
installing the module, launching the application, and invoking the focused
test script were exercised. Shell syntax checks and Python compilation passed.
An intentionally altered executable in the disposable reproduction runtime was
correctly rejected by the integrity checker and then restored and reverified.

## Direct2D custom-effect identity regression

The same final test executable was run against two independent prefixes:

| Runtime | Checks executed | Failures | Skipped |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Stock WineHQ 11.17 | 17 | 6 | 0 |
| Wine with the interface fix | 26 | 0 | 0 |

The patched run reaches additional property round-trip checks because effect
creation succeeds. The stock run fails effect creation, skips those dependent
checks, and also fails initialization, interface-rejection, and failure-code
checks. Both runs exercise the builtin Flood property path.

These are COM initialization, property, and lifetime tests, not pixel-rendering
tests. They have not yet been run against Microsoft's Direct2D on Windows.

## Application retest

The normal application loads Wine's builtin `d2d1.dll`. The custom device-feature
effect reaches its `ID2D1EffectContext1` query and reports `E_NOINTERFACE`, rather
than invoking the wrong implementation vtable. The earlier disposal access
violation was not observed in this run.

Startup still fails. The trace records the missing Histogram effect and missing
effect-context interface; display-aware window creation also encounters
`REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG` for `Windows.System.DispatcherQueue`. See STATUS.md.

The entire Wine test suite and the real GPU rendering path have not been
validated for this fork. There is no claim yet of usable application editing.
